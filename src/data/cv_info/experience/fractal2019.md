Took part in the development of an OAuth platform for personal identification (Log in with Fractal ID) with KYC/AML regulation.
The main difficulty was to quickly adapt to a big codebase in a new technology stack while also having to understand the complex OAuth
protocol, along with following strict security standards.

My two biggest breakthroughs were succesfully migrating the GitHub organizationâ€™s configurations to Terraform (enabling them to be peer-
reviewed and version controlled) and setting up a mailer service in a micro-service that enabled sending e-mail confirmations for live verification bookings.

**Technologies used:**

* Ruby on Rails, minitest
* Docker, CircleCI, Terraform
* React, Redux, Jest, react-testing-library
