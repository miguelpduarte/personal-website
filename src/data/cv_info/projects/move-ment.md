Open-source Front-End for public transport schedules. The existing app and website are not very good, thus the creation of this responsive PWApp.

The major challenges were creating a design on my own and working with an undocumented API.
These problems were overcome by being persistent and through trial and error.

Sadly the project is currently not working since the APIs used were locked down by the transportation network companies.
I hope to either contact them about this situation (unlikely to work out, sadly) or reverse-engineer the "protection" and probably get over it via some reverse proxies or similar :)

**Technologies:**

- GatsbyJS, React
- Material UI
- Progressive Web App (PWA)
