Early steps into learning Javascript by recreating popular games. Impelemnted Brickbreak, Minesweeper, Pong and Tetris, sometimes in more limited versions than the original games.

These were implemented mostly over 1-2 day sprints during the school year, thus their unfinished state and potential bugs. However, since this was one of my first personal projects that actually became anything useful, I found it interesting enough to share :)

**Technologies:**

- Javascript for the core implementation
- HTML for some visual aspects, with maybe some inline CSS here and there
