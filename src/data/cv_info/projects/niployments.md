Custom-built Continuous Deployment tool for the branchâ€™s projects. Features Slack integration via its API and auto-deployment via Git.

The biggest challenge was being able to provide a consistent environment for deployment, which was solved by robust Bash scripts and careful Docker configuration.

I created this since I notised how troublesome and undocumented the manual configuration of the branch's server was. This was an effort to not only automate what can be automated but also document what can't in order for the "next ones in line" be able to take advantage of this ease of use, since now the configurations are simplified and version controlled :)

**Technologies:**

- Bash, Docker, Git, Apache, Linux SysAdmin
