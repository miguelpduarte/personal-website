**This is a second post**

Wow this is a lot of content!
I'm going to write down some code!

```javascript{numberLines: true}
this = "amazing code";
that = this;

// Typical js lmao

for (let i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    console.log(i);
}
```

Wasn't that nice code? A footnote now.[^note1]

This blog post is currently disabled but needs to exist to serve as a mock for tags to exist in the GraphQL schema :)
If I only have posts without tags, it crashes when trying to access that property :)))

[^note1]: Just testing if this works!
